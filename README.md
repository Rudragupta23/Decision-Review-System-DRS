# Decision Review System (DRS) Simulator
A Python-based simulator for the cricket Decision Review System (DRS) using Tkinter for the GUI and OpenCV for video processing.

### Problem Statement:
In the sport of cricket, umpiring decisions can be contentious and have a significant impact on the outcome of a match.

The Decision Review System (D.R.S.) was introduced to minimize human error, but its intricacies can be complex for fans, aspiring umpires, and developers.

There is a need for a simple, interactive tool that can simulate the DRS process, providing a clear visual representation of the review and decision-making workflow.

### About The Project:
This project is a comprehensive cricket DRS simulator built with Python.

It provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) where users can review an umpiring decision by watching video playback, just like in a real match.

### The core features include:
<ul>
<li>Interactive GUI: A user-friendly interface built with Tkinter to manage the review process.</li>

<li>Video Playback: Simulates the third umpire's review by playing the clip associated with the appeal. Users can confirm if the batsman is "Out" or "Not Out".</li>

<li>Replay Controls: Functionality for slow-motion and fast-motion replays to analyze the event closely, making it ideal for checking tight run-outs and stumpings.</li>

<li>Decision Animations: Engaging animations to indicate a "Decision Pending" state while the review is in progress.</li>

<li>This simulator serves as an excellent educational tool for cricket enthusiasts and a practical demonstration of GUI development with Python.</li>

<li>Stump Impact Prediction: Allows the user to select the stump area to predict whether the ball would have hit the wickets, assisting in LBW decisions.</li>
</ul>
